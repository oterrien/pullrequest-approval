<h1>Pull Request Approval</h1>
<p>This webservice is called by a sgithub repository as a webhook</p>
<i>A webhook is defined by a payload (this webservice in fact) and a set of github's events</i>
<i>And it aims to update a status on the pull request</i>
<i>The status' context which is updated by current webhook is ${status.context}</i>
<p>This current webhook reacts for ticked events as follow:</p>
<div>
    <h2>1. Issue Comment</h2>
    <i>Triggered each time Issue is commented on (a pull request is also an issue)</i>
    <br/>
    <i>
        When a user types ${issue.comments.list.approval}, the status is set to SUCCESS (regarding to auto-approval
        rules)
        <br/>
        When a user types ${issue.comments.list.rejection}, the status is set to ERROR
        <br/>
        When a user types ${issue.comments.list.pending}, the status is set to PENDING
    </i>
    <h4><i>Auto-approval</i></h4>
    <i>
        Given a user who has created the pull request.
        <br/>
        When the same user tries to approve its own pull request, a remote configuration is checked to determine whether
        auto-approval is authorized or not
        <br/>
        This remote configuration is stored in ${remote.configuration.path}
        <br/>
        The key ${remote.configuration.auto_approval.authorized.key} defines whether the auto-approval is authorized or
        not.
        <h5>What to do if auto-approval is forbidden and I am alone?</h5>
        It this case, user can types ${issue.comments.list.autoapproval} and provides a comment.
        <br/>
        A mail will be sent to all repository owners
